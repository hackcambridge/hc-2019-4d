  - name: Beaker API
    description: |
      [The Beaker Notebook](http://beakernotebook.com/) is a new open source tool for collaborative data science. Beaker has an innovative UI and unique architecture to make
      it easier for novices to get started, and enable experts to work faster. Like IPython, Beaker uses a notebook-based UI metaphor, but Beaker was
      designed to be polyglot from the ground up. That is, a single notebook may contain cells from multiple different languages that communicate with one
      another through a unique feature called autotranslation. You can set a variable in a Python cell and then read that variable in a subsequent R cell,
      and everything just works – magically. Beaker comes with built-in support for Python, R, JavaScript, Java, Scala, Clojure, Julia, and more.

      Each part of your problem can be solved in the language best suited to it. For example, you can scrape the web in Python, do a regression in R, and
      then visualize it with d3.js, seamlessly and all in the same notebook.
