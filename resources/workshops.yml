      or 100s of millions of users rapidly.

      We will analyse the key technological changes that are driving this revolution, illustrate some of the complex programming challenges
      that arise, and discuss the opportunities for software developers in this domain.

      Finance has been a Big Data arena for decades, long before the term FinTech was coined. We will review the opportunities for programmers

      There will be some visualisations of how one trades billions of dollars a day, and how one copes with millisecond updates to the data that
      feeds ‘black box’ trading models.
