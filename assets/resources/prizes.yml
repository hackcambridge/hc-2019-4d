    us receipt information for your transactions. This information will be displayed
    in the app in the details screen for that transaction. The challenge is to figure

    Parse email receipts for purchases 2. Use OCR on images of paper receipts 3.

    Borderless Account, also known as Balances, is our latest offering that allows our
    customers to receive and hold money in over 40 currencies with zero fees. It isn't
    just a traditional multi-currency account where one could only load money in a specific
    currency, it rather offers local bank account details for receiving USD, EUR, GBP,
    AUD and NZD. This allows our customers to pay (or be paid) in a specific currency
    immediately, without any foreign exchange conversion, as if they actually had an
    account in the country operating with the said currency. Moreover, our customers could
    also use their TransferWise Debit Card globally, without ever having to worry about
    converting currencies - we automatically use their balance from the currency that
    offers them best conversion rates to fund their spending!
    Build a solution that frees our customers from having to manually perform payments of
    repetitive nature from their Borderless Accounts. Imagine you are a freelance software
    engineer who takes up projects from clients globally, uses borderless account to get
    paid, and has direct debits set up with a local bank for paying all the bills. Or imagine
    you are an expat who needs to send a portion of their salary to their family in their
    home country. Or perhaps you are a traveller who is planning a trip abroad and wants to
    hedge funds systematically to prevent against dramatic fluctuation of exchange rates.
    Wouldn't it be awesome if TransferWise does all the work for you to perform smart
    conversions using your preferences?

    TPP are excited to announce a competition for the Cambridge Hackathon. At
    TPP, we are revolutionising patient healthcare, both within the NHS and across
    the world. To do this, our Software Developers are always looking at improvements
    to our system and working on new ways to give patients more control over their
    own care. This year we want to give you a chance to test your skills by creating
    your own revolutionary design for the healthcare industry. TPP will be providing
    access to dummy patient data from SystmOne, one of the UK’s largest digital
    healthcare systems. You will be able to integrate with SystmOne, retrieving
    patient data and booking appointments. Access will be available to demographic
    data, appointment information, drug history, allergies and medical sensitivities. You
    will have free range to use this data, perhaps to develop an app or piece of
    software that could be used to improve patient care. You could create a revolutionary
    new appointment booking system or a personal healthcare application- the possibilities
    are endless.
