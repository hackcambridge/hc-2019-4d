    - name: Microsoft Cognitive Services and Bot Framework
      description: |
        Artificial intelligence isn't just for processing requests and synthesizing data anymore. Now, technology such as Cognitive Services allow developers
        to understand sentiment, a trend known as affective computing. The idea is, that by understanding emotions, artificially intelligent technology could
        predict a person's needs in drastically more human ways.
        
        So can you use facial expressions to determine how much user is engaged with your content or even greet them with a smile? The challenge - develop a
        solution that Relies on the Cognitive Services or Microsoft Bot Framework and has at least one of the following
        
        - Use emotion detection to provide a new means of interaction with the user of the application.
        - Solve or improve a real-world problem.
        - Incorporate the use of a cameras (whether in phones, robots using Kinect, Realsense or Laptop/Mobile inbuilt Camera).
        - Provided in an application for Web or iOS, Android and Windows 10
      prize: |
        - 1 set per team members (total 4 sets) Microsoft Azure IOT starter Kits 
        - 1 Raspberry Pi IOT Kit with Feather Hat and accessories
        - 1 Adafriut Feather IO kits and accessories
        - T-shirt, stickers, USB key, power bank speakers and charger, selfie stick, hoodie pillow and stress toys

    - name: eLife Challenge
      description: |
        Are you interested in the benefit that open access, open science and open data could bring to the world? The way that
        scientific research is shared and evaluated still bears the legacy of a system based around print media. New technologies
        in the digital era present a huge opportunity to accelerate discovery and make science collaborative instead of
        competitive. Will you help us to transform biology with technology?

        At Hack Cambridge, we challenge you to develop a prototype tool or technological solution that improves how scientists,
        academics and the public interact with cutting-edge research. You could explore ways to help researchers share their own
        work or review their peers' work in a fast, transparent and collaborative manner, your tool could enhance the
        discoverability or accessibility of new research, or you may have a completely new idea for how we can make the best
        science even better. Whatever you build, we'll be looking out for ideas that utilise the eLife API, showcase open
        research outputs (papers, data, code), or build on other openly-available resources in research technology.
      prize: Raspberry Pi Model 3 plus GrovePi+ IoT Starter Kit

    - name: Argon Design Challenge
      description:  |
        We challenge you to connect a speech-to-text engine to a LSTM machine learning network to a text-to-speech engine. Users can then speak to the
        device for a while (or select a personality trained from a pre-existing corpus of text). Then I can say half a sentence and allow the “Sentence
        Finisher” to predict and say the rest. We'll bring along some Amazon Echo Dots to provide the voice I/O and our engineers will be pitching in to
        help teams who want to explore and create some interesting examples in this area. [See here](http://www.argondesign.com/news/2017/jan/11/hack-cambridge-2017/)

        Produce an app to create a way for festival participants to interact with the event by becoming active part of it. Perhaps by transforming their
        own devices into light beams themselves. Imagine a square or a stadium filled with people holding their mobile phones and having them changing
        colours on randomly selected patterns or at the rhythm of music!
      prize: Tickets to either the opening performance of [e-Luminate Cambridge](https://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/cornex/events/e-luminate-dark-light)
        or the [Play of Light events](https://www.cambridgelivetrust.co.uk/e-luminate/e-luminate/play-light).
