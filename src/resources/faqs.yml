faqs:
  - question: What is a hackathon?
    answer: A hackathon is a focused 24-hour event where you and a small team get to build something new and exciting, alongside a whole bunch of likeminded people.

  - question: Can I attend?
    answer: If you're 18 or over, and a student at any school or university, or were still a student after the 28<sup>th</sup> of January 2016, you're welcome to apply.

  - question: Do I have to be doing Computer Science or other programming-related degree to take part?
    answer: No — we welcome everyone to apply whatever your subject or university!

  - question: Does this cost money?
    answer: Entry is completely free — in fact, we'll even reimburse some of your travel costs. However, if you are arriving internationally, we won't be able to cover a significant portion of your costs.

  - question: Why do I need to provide a CV?
    answer: Select sponsors will have access to your CV. This is so that you can get on their radar and they can get access to you for recruitment purposes. Win-win!

  - question: What will I eat?
    answer: We'll provide the food and drinks, leaving you to concentrate on your project.

  - question: Where will I sleep?
    answer: We'll have a room to nap in during the event — so bring a sleeping bag just in case. If you're coming from farther away, we're working on a Host-a-Hacker scheme to provide a place to crash on the Friday evening — more information on that coming soon.

  - question: What should I bring?
    answer: You'll need a laptop for your hacking — everything else depends on your project. Bring along any hardware you might need.

  - question: What if I don’t know what I want to do?
    answer: Joining a team is a great way to develop ideas with others, and to make sure you're making the most of the hackathon. When you apply, you can ask us to place you in a team so you can hit the ground running.

  - question: How do I get there?
    answer: The nearest station to Hack Cambridge is the Cambridge train station. From there it’s just a 20 minute walk to the Corn Exchange.

  - question: How do teams work?
    answer: You can have teams of up to 4 members. After you submit your application, you'll be able to form a team [from the dashboard](/apply/dashboard). This team will be used to evaluate applications, but is not binding. You may later decide to work with others during the event.

  - question: What if not all of us get invited when applying as a team?
    answer: Either every member of a team will be invited, or none of them will be.

  - question: Since I'm travelling from far away, can I get an increase in reimbursement?
    answer: We will try to make reimbursements as fair as possible. After all applications have been reviewed, all invited applicants will be contacted with specifics about reimbursement details. However, if you're travelling from outside the EU it is *unlikely* we'll be able to make a significant contribution to your travel costs.

  - question: What about hardware hacks?
    answer: We love ‘em! We'll provide the basics (soldering kits, breadboards, etc...) and you do the rest. Do bring along any special equipment you might want to hack on as well.

  - question: When do applications close?
    answer: Applications close on December 15<sup>th</sup> at 23:59.

  - question: When will I find out whether I have a ticket?
    answer: We will be sending out invitations on a rolling basis as applications come in. If you're coming from far away, we'll aim to get back to you sooner to give you time to sort out travel arrangements.

  - question: What if I still have a question that hasn't been answered?
    answer: Contact us at [team@hackcambridge.com](mailto:team@hackcambridge.com), and we'll do our best to get back to you promptly.
