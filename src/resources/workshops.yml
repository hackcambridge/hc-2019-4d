  - name: Give your project a boost with the Microsoft Bot Framework
    description: |
      First we had the web, we were able to connect people with information
      using mice and keyboards. Then we had apps, written natively to take
      advantage of device sensors and operating systems. Next in the information
      revolution is Bots, making it simpler and quicker to connect users with
      the information and services that they need and using more natural methods
      of interaction.

      In this talk I will open up the Microsoft Bot Framework, show how to
      develop a Bot using it and show you that you have the skills to do this
      too. You will also be introduced to the Cognitive Services APIs and see
      how you can use them to transform your applications through a simple API
      call.
